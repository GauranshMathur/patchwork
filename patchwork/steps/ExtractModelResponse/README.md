# ExtractModelResponse Class Documentation

## Summary
`ExtractModelResponse` is a Python class, which is a part of the 'patchwork' package. The class is essentially designed to process and extract responses from OpenAI model. It requires certain keys in the input dictionary and return certain keys in the output dictionary after performing its operation.

## Method: __init__(self, inputs: dict)

- **Purpose:** Initializes an instance of the `ExtractModelResponse` class.
- **Inputs:** A dictionary `inputs` with keys:
    - "openai_responses" (required): contains the responses from OpenAI 
    - "response_partitions" (optional): lists the partitions of the responses; if not provided, it is initialized to an empty list.

- **Output:** No direct output, but the instance of the class is initialized with `self.openai_responses` set to 'openai_responses' from inputs, and `self.partitions` set to the 'response_partitions' from inputs or an empty list if it is not provided.

## Method: run(self) -> dict

- **Purpose:** This method processes `self.openai_responses` and `self.partitions`, and extracts responses using partitions logic. If there are no partitions specified, it will return an empty list of extracted responses.

- **Input:** No inputs are required.

- **Output:** Returns a dictionary with the key:
    - "extracted_responses": A list of dictionaries with keys as provided in the partitions if it's not empty; otherwise, the original openai_response. If no partitions are specified, it returns an empty list.

*Note:* The class makes extensive use of Python's logging module to log the start and completion of the run, as well as errors if no partitions are specified.
