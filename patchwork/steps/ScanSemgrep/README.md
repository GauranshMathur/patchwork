# ScanSemgrep Class Documentation

## Overview

This class `ScanSemgrep` is part of the class `Step`. It is responsible for executing a `semgrep` (Semantic Grep) scan in the current working directory.  

Semgrep is a command-line tool that is used for powerful code scanning. This class takes a dictionary as an input, starts the scan if it doesn't exist, and outputs the path to the resulting SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) file.

## __init__ method

This method initiates the `ScanSemgrep` object and logs the start of a scan.

### Inputs

The input expected is:

- `inputs`: A dictionary that may contain the key `sarif_file_path`.

### Process

This method checks if the `sarif_file_path` is given in the `inputs`. If it is present, the scan is considered as not enabled.

## run method

This method performs the real task of the `ScanSemgrep` object: conducting the `semgrep` scan.

### Inputs

There are no expected inputs for this method.

### Process

The `run` function checks if the scan was previously enabled during the object initiation. If not, it skips and logs the action. If yes, it performs the `semgrep` scan and logs it. The process consists of generating a temporary SARIF file, writing the `semgrep` command output to it, and returning its path.

### Outputs

The output of the `run` method is a dictionary that may contain:

- `sarif_file_path`: A `Path` object pointing to the SARIF file generated by the scan. This key is only present if the scan was enabled and run.
