# ScanDepscan Class Documentation

This documentation describes the `init` and `run` methods from the ScanDepscan class, that can be found in the file `/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/patchwork/patchwork/steps/ScanDepscan/ScanDepscan.py`.

## Overview
The ScanDepscan class is primarily used to generate an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) report using the 'depscan' command-line tool. It has two methods, `__init__` and `run`.

## __init__(self, inputs: dict)
This is the initialization method for the ScanDepscan class.

### Inputs
- `inputs` (dict) - A dictionary which is required for initializing the class. The dictionary structure and its content will depend on the specific requirements of the class. The key `language` is optional, which can be used to specify a programming language for the 
'depscan' tool to target.

### Side Effects
- Logs the start of the run to the application's logger, indicating which class is being instantiated.
- Checks for the presence of the 'cdxgen' command-line tool. If 'cdxgen' is not found, it installs 'cdxgen' globally using npm.

## run(self) -> dict
This method executes the 'depscan' command-line tool, creating an SBOM report.

### Outputs
- A dictionary containing a single key-value pair. The key `'sbom_vdr_file_path'` indicates the path where the SBOM report file is generated. 

### Side Effects
- Executes a 'depscan' command, which might modify files in a certain directory and generate network traffic.
- Logs the start and completion of the operation in the application's logger.
