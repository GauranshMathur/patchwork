# ModifyCode

This Python script forms part of the Patchwork package and defines a class `ModifyCode`. Its key responsibility is to perform modifications on a given code file based on specific provided instructions.

## Initialization (inputs)
The `ModifyCode` class is initialized by the `__init__(self, inputs: dict)` method which requires a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 

1. `code_file`: A string that points to the JSON file which contains an array of code snippets that need to be replaced. 
  Each entry in the array is a dictionary with the following keys:
    - `uri`: String indicating the path of the file to modify.
    - `startLine`: Integer indicating start line number where the code snippet starts.
    - `endLine`: Integer indicating end line where the code snippet ends.
    
2. `extracted_responses`: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents an extracted response. Each dictionary contains a `patch` key that represents the new code to replace the specific snippet.

The method will raise a `ValueError` if any of the required keys are missing.

## Execution (outputs)
The execution of the ModifyCode class is through the `run(self) -> dict` method. It modifies the code files according their line numbers based on the sorted list formed using the `code_file` and `extracted_responses` inputs. 

The modified files and their modifications are then stored and returned as a list of dictionaries under the key `modified_code_files` with each dictionary containing:
- `path`: String that represents the location of the modified code file.
- `start_line`: Integer indicating the start line number of the replaced code snippet.
- `end_line`: Integer indicating the end line number of the replaced code snippet.
- `extracted_response`: Dictionary representing the corresponding extracted response. 

This output can be used to access the modifications made to the code files and their location for further utilization.
