# ExtractPackageManagerFile Class

This script defines a class called ExtractPackageManagerFile that uses an existing SBOM VDR (Software Bill of Materials Vulnerability Discovery Results) file to extract and manipulate data from listed components and vulnerabilities.

## Class Methods
The two primary methods of ExtractPackageManagerFile class are `__init__` and `run`. 

### `__init__` Method
The `__init__` method is the initializer for ExtractPackageManagerFile class. It takes one required argument - `inputs`: a dictionary containing input parameters. This method validates and sets the SBOM VDR file path, as well as sets up instance-specific requirements for data extraction.

#### Inputs
This method expects a dictionary with the following key(s):

- `"sbom_vdr_file_path"`: This is the path to the Software Bill of Materials Vulnerability Discovery Results (SBOM VDR) file.
- `"package_manager_file"`: This is an optional path to the package manager file. If not provided, the method tries to identify this file from the current directory based on the PURL in SBOM VDR data.
- `"upgrade_threshold"`: This optional key specifies the level at which the software version can be upgraded. The default value is "major". 
- `"severity"`: This optional key specifies the severity threshold of vulnerabilities. Its default value is "none".

### `run` Method
The `run` method runs the main data extraction and manipulation processes. It extracts the vulnerability information from the SBOM VDR file, maps PURLs to their corresponding source files, identifies affected and unaffected versions, and compiles this data into a structured format. The method then saves the extracted data to a temporary JSON file.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't require any explicit inputs since it works with the attributes initialized by the `__init__` method.

#### Outputs
This method returns a dictionary with two keys:

- `"prompt_value_file"`: The path of the file containing the extracted data. This file holds a JSON formatted object with information about package manager files and updates.
- `"code_file"`: The path to the file with the code updates. In this case, it points to the same file as `prompt_value_file`.

Both files are stored in a temporary location.
